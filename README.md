# limitless_factorisation_algorithms
We will study some factorization algorithms,firstly we will use Eratosth√®ne's, algorithm, also Rabin-Miller's algorithm to determine if the number is prime, if not we will then factorise with a fairly complex algorithm. After that we will compare running time results we a classical algorithm.

# Comment tester le programme
taper par exemple:    ./app 1000      (pour factoriser le nombre 1000)
